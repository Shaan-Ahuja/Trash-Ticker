# Trash Ticker
## Decide who takes out the trash based on company stock performance

Too often, the trash can in my apartment remains full until the stench is so unbearable that one of our three roommates cracks and takes it out. So, I created 'Trash Ticker' to determine who will take the trash out based on our employers' stock performance. Every weekday at 2 pm PT, my computer runs this Python script which sends a text to each of us, announcing who's stock had the largest percentage gain from that day's open to close and, subsequently, who is on trash duty for that evening.

What chores seldom get done in your household? You may modify this script in several ways for your specific situarion: 
Chore/task
Criteria: best/worst weekly/daily performance
Specific Stocks: we chose our employers, but you can use any of your favorite public companies
